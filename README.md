# fastapi_domain-centric_skeleton
A skeleton for a lightweight domain-centric approach using FastAPI. 

This example uses DbContext instead of the repository pattern for simplicity. The repository pattern is more complete for full domain-centric approaches like hexagonal architecture. Therefore, this skeleton is intended for small applications that still want to use a domain-centric approach while avoiding the complexity of hexagonal architecture.
